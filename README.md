# Hello, GitHub!
This is my first repository on GitHub.
Today I'm working through GitHub's [quickstart guide](
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart).

# What I learned today.
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in computer files.  It was
originally authored by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel. GitHub,
which is built on top of Git, is an online platform for software developers to
store, manage, and collaborate on code.

# Git Commands
Git is available at the command line.
* `git init` creates a Git repository in the current working directory.
* `git clone [repo]` copies a repository on GitHub to the local machine.
* `git status` shows the state of a project managed with Git.
* `git add [file(s)]` stages the specified files for a commit.
* `git commit` saves a 'snapshot' of the project.
* `git push origin main` enacts commits and uploads them to GitHub.
